Tramp stands for `Transparent Remote (file) Access, Multiple
Protocol'.  This package provides remote file editing, similar to
Ange-FTP and EFS.

The difference is that Ange-FTP uses FTP to transfer files between the
local and the remote host, whereas Tramp uses a combination of `rsh'
and `rcp' or other work-alike programs, such as `ssh'/`scp'.

This is the XEmacs Package version of Tramp.  It is identical to the
mainline version of Tramp except that it doesn't contain the experimental
Tramp2 code. (see below "Getting Tramp2")

Getting Tramp2:
---------------
The experimental Tramp2 code is not included in the XEmacs package.  To
get hold of it, just grab it from CVS:

   cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@cvs.tramp.sf.net:/cvsroot/tramp co tramp

You'll find the Tramp2 code in the 'tramp2' subdirectory.  But be warned,
this is experimental code.  More likely than not, it probably won't run,
and probably will break things.  Use at your own risk.
